This repo is inteded to help you solidify your understanding of basice Nodejs server concepts. It is recommended you do this by building out a single route at a time, following the data through the entire request response stack.

It uses Express, mySQL, and the Bluebird Promise library. Use Postman as your Client to send your requests. It is recommended that you send all of your data as JSON, but you can use any format that you wish. Your response for delete should be an empty object, everything else should return either the object(s) you requested, or the object that was updated or added.

Check your work often with console.log() and postman to catch bugs early and help you visualize the data flow.
